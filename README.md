# Phone Roulette

This is exactly what it sounds like. I wanted to experiment with the [Twilio API](https://www.twilio.com/voice/api),
and this seemed like a quick and easy application to make.

Call (480) 878-7813 and you'll randomly be connected with anyone else who is currently calling the same number.

## To start the server in development
```
$> shotgun config.ru
```

## Optional `.env`
```
TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER= "(xxx) yyy-zzzz"
```
